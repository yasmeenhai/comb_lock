This Verilog project implements a digital combination lock system using a 16-bit binary code (representing 4 BCD digits) entered via a keypad. The system compares the entered 
code with a preset code and allows a maximum of three attempts to unlock the door. If the code is entered incorrectly three times, 
the system locks the door until the reset button is pressed
